Power BI Project: MAHA-E-SAVA Ecommerce Sales Dashboard

Excited to share my latest data visualization project built using Microsoft Power BI!

This interactive dashboard presents key metrics and insights for the MAHA-E-SAVA Ecommerce platform, including:

Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Amount

Sales breakdown by State and Customer

Category-wise and Sub-category-wise analysis
